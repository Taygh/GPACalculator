# GPA Calculator

This is a program I recently made for my own use one afternoon. I was tired of retyping all my grades/credits into my college's online GPA calculator everytime to predict my GPA for certain grades in my current classes, so I made a program that would use two text files that contained grades/credits and calculated the overall GPA. This way, I can make changes to one or two lines to see the outcome, rather than enter all of my grades over and over again. Saves a lot of time. Please note that I designed this for a quarter college system, not semester. Additionally, you'll need one file with grades (in 4.0 format) and one with credits, with each line per file corresponding to the same line in the other file. For example:

Grades File:
4.0 (for a 5 credit class)
3.7 (for a 3 credit class)
3.7 (for a 1 credit class)

Credits File:
5
3
1
